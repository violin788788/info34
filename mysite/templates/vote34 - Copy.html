const explanation = '5% of US citizens in a state of voting age may initiate a ballot measure vote on any local, state, or federal statute(s) or amendment(s). Ballot measure votes in 34 states passing the statute(s) or amendment(s) by majority of those voting becomes enacted or repealed to the federal legal codes and/or US Constitution. The result of this vote supersedes and overrides the Congress, President and the Supreme Court.<br><br>Tell your local/state/federal politician(s) that you will not vote for them unless they create this. Eventually the only people that win the primaries are the people who support this, after which you get this system.<br><br>The 10th amendment to the Constitution establishes a direct measure in each of the 50 states as it states "or to the people" in the clause. This establishes a direct vote that is not to the "states", which refers to the state "government". See Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon (1912). This direct democratic procedure is law, all that is needed is that SCOTUS validates it. The last part of the 10th amendment reads, "or to the people." 10th Amendment below. "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." The use of the word "or" is an equivalence between "to the people" (a direct democratic system/direct vote/direct measure/ballot measure) and "the States" (state govt). The equivalence does not preclude one from the other, so, a direct measure cannot be prohibited, which, overrides a state "representative".'
